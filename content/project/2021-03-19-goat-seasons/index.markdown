Dustin Martin, Wayne Carey, and Buddy Franklin are some of the most dominant, jaw-dropping, once-in-a-generation talents that the AFL has seen. But who has had the season which stands out among some of the greatest individual seasons of all time?

It's a hard question to answer, and its true that football looks very different in 2021 compared to 1990 - so can we compare player seasons? It turns out you can. By comparing the average statistical output of each player in each season, we are able to see which players have had the most similar seasons, and more importantly, which players had the best statistical seasons and which players have come close to replicate it.


# Dustin Martin 2017
With 1 minute and 10 seconds to go in the 2020 grand final, Martin finally eclipsed Richo as my favorite Tiger of all time. Shrugging off Dangerfield to kick a snap from the boundary, Dusty officially cemented his stature as a god among men. It was one of those moments where you looked around and simply said, I have not seen anything like that. And aren't those moments what make sport great?

But it was season 2017 when Dusty become a unicorn. Averaging 30 disposals, 1.5 goals, and 6 clearances a game while also accumulating a ridiculous 36 brownlow votes, Dusty joined the unicorn club. Labeled as the 'perfect season,' Dusty was also awarded the Players MVP, Brownlow Medal, AFL Coaches Award, Premiership Medal and a Norm Smith. Damn. There is no doubt that this season was one of the best ever. Its a testament to how good it was, as the most comparable seasons in the last 30 years are those that resulted in brownlow medal wins. Fyfe, Dangerfield, 

At the end of the season he went into Brownlow night as the shortest favorite in history and by the end of his career he will likely be among one of the greatest players of all time.
